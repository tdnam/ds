Therefore, when we have a large sample size, we can say that the sampling distribution for the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the distribution from which we are sampling.\n","\n","Let's start by taking a look at the data, **`Total Household Income`** will serve as a \"population\" for the purposes of this lab.
